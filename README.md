### **CIFAR-10 Image Classification Prject**

This project aims to develop and deploy a lightweight machine learning model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten categories: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. We will be taking advantage of transfer learning by using MobileNetV2, a signifcant advancement over its predecessor by employing depthwise convolution and residual layers allowing gradients to travel forward and back-propagate throught the network faster, ultimately striking a good balance between efficiency, performance and size. 

This project will encompasses not just model development but also best practices in MLOps, including model containerization, API development, monitoring, and CI/CD integration.


### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Docker (for containerization)
- Git (for verison control)


### **Installation**

clone the repositiory to your local machine:
`git clone [git@github.com:Oliver2552/MLOps.git]`
