### **Abstractive Text Summarization using Pegasus -**

This project aims to develop and deploy a machine learning model which will produce abstractive text summarization from the ______ dataset. We will be taking advantage of transfer learning by using the Pegasus model, based on transformer architecture. 

This project will encompasses not just model development but also best practices in MLOps, including model containerization, API development, monitoring, and CI/CD integration.


### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Install Pytorch
- Docker (for containerization)
- Git (for verison control)


### **Installation**

clone the repositiory to your local machine:

`git clone [git@github.com:Oliver2552/MLOps.git]`
