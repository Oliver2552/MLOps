#*CIFAR-10 Image Classification Prject*
This project aims to develop and deploy a machine learning model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten categories: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. It encompasses not just model development but also best practices in MLOps, including model containerization, API development, monitoring, and CI/CD integration.

#*Prerequisites*
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Docker (for containerization)
- Git (for verison control)
